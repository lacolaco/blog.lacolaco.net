While developing Angular applications with Signals, I frequently encounter the need for practical utilities not yet supported by the framework. This prototype addresses specific challenges when working with `effect()`.

## Wait for the next change

When working with signals, I sometimes need to delay a function's execution until the next signal change. However, using `effect()` presents two key problems in this scenario.

1. The first `effect()` execution uses the current signal value.
2. An `effect()` cannot be destroyed from within its own callback function.

As a result, here's an example implementation of `waitForNextChange()`. This function returns a `Promise<T>` that resolves with the next value from the source `Signal<T>`. The function skips the first (current) value, uses the second value to resolve the promise, and when the promise resolves, the watcher will be destroyed.

```ts
function waitForNextChange<T>(source: Signal<T>, injector: Injector): Promise<T> {
  let watcher: EffectRef;
  const p = new Promise<T>((resolve) => {
    let first = true;
    watcher = effect(
      () => {
        const value = source();
        if (first) {
          // skip the first value
          first = false;
        } else {
          untracked(() => resolve(value));
        }
      },
      { injector, manualCleanup: true },
    );
  });
  return p.finally(() => watcher.destroy());
}

const touched = signal(false);
waitForNextChange(touched, injector).then(() => {
  console.log('touched');
});
```

The implementation above is virtually identical to this:

```ts
// Rewrite with rxjs-interop
function waitForNextChange<T>(source: Signal<T>, injector: Injector): Promise<T> {
  return firstValueFrom(toObservable(source, { injector }).pipe(skip(1)));
}
```

Alternatively, using a callback function style similar to Angular's `afterNextRender`, the implementation would look like this:

```ts
function afterNextChange<T>(source: Signal<T>, injector: Injector, callback: (value: T) => void): void {
  let watcher: EffectRef;
  const p = new Promise<T>((resolve) => {
    let first = true;
    watcher = effect(
      () => {
        const value = source();
        if (first) {
          // skip the first value
          first = false;
        } else {
          untracked(() => resolve(value));
        }
      },
      { injector, manualCleanup: true },
    );
  });
  p.then(callback).finally(() => watcher.destroy());
}

const touched = signal(false);
afterNextChange(touched, injector, () => {
  console.log('touched');
});
```

## Considerations

Although these implementations are functional, there are some drawbacks to consider. The requirement for an `Injector` particularly degrades the developer experience. While Promises are a native JavaScript feature and Signals are meant to be Angular's "primitives," converting between them is unexpectedly complex. This conversion process should be more intuitive and require less boilerplate.
