Although Angular allows us to use `NoopNgZone` to make an app zoneless, still some Angular modules are depending on Zone implicitly.

## `ngOnInit` of Routed Component won’t be called!

I hit a problem when using Angular Router without Zone. Routing looks working but `ngOnInit` method of the routed component has not been executed.

It is because Angular Router depends on Zone in route activation. Technically, Router internally calls `ChangeDetectorRef#markForCheck` to re-render after route change. [https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/directives/router_outlet.ts#L142](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/packages/router/src/directives/router_outlet.ts#L142)

[As I wrote previously](https://blog.lacolaco.net/2020/03/angular-app-reactiveness-en/), `markForCheck` won’t trigger Change Detection without Zone.

## Call `detectChanges` on `(activate)`

Here is a solution, maybe just a workaround.

```plaintext
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <router-outlet (activate)="onRouteActivated()"></router-outlet>
`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private cdRef: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  onRouteActivated() {
  }
}
```

`RouterOutlet` component is exposing `(activate)` output. It emits events on route has been activated. So I can trigger Change Detection after route activation.

```plaintext
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
    <router-outlet (activate)="onRouteActivated()"></router-outlet>
`,
})
export class AppComponent {
  constructor(private cdRef: ChangeDetectorRef) {}

  onRouteActivated() {
    // Call OnInit of routed component
    this.cdRef.detectChanges();
  }
}
```
